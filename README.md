#  Tracking ships with OBSs

Data and codes used to run the simulations and produce the figures found in:

Trabattoni, A., Barruol, G., Dréo, R., & Boudraa, A. (2023). Ship detection and tracking from single ocean-bottom seismic and hydroacoustic stations. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 153(1), 260–273. https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0016810

Codes heavily rely on the [obsea](https://github.com/atrabattoni/obsea) package that must be installed. 

All computations can be run by lauching the `run.sh` script.
